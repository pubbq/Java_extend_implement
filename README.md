# Java Inheritance and Interface Implementation Examples

This project provides examples of Java classes that demonstrate the use of inheritance (extends) and interface implementation (implements). It serves as a learning resource for understanding how Java's object-oriented principles are applied in practice.

### Features
- Inheritance (extends): Shows how a subclass can inherit properties and methods from a superclass.
- Interface Implementation (implements): Illustrates how classes can implement interfaces to define specific behaviors.
- Practical Examples: Includes real-world scenarios to contextualize the use of inheritance and interfaces.

### Project Structure
- ```Area.java```: Defines an interface for calculating the area of shapes.
- ```ButterBall.java```: A class that extends Ball and implements the Edible interface.
- ```Circle.java```: A class that extends Shape and implements the Area interface.
- ```Edible.java```: An interface that defines edible objects.
- ```Main.java```: The main class to run and test the examples.
- ```Shape.java```: An abstract class that serves as a superclass for various shapes.
- ```Sphere.java```: A class that extends Shape and implements the Area interface.
